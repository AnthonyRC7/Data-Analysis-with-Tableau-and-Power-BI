## Airbnb-Home-Listings-and-Video-Game-Sales-Analysis-Using-Tableau

**1. Airbnb Home Listings Analysis Using Tableau:**

In this project, I delve into the world of Airbnb by analyzing home listings data using the powerful visualization capabilities of Tableau. Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, I uncover key trends, patterns, and insights related to Airbnb listings. Whether you're interested in understanding pricing dynamics, property types, or geographical distribution of Airbnb homes, this project has you covered. Explore the beauty of Tableau as I transform raw data into meaningful visual narratives, offering a deeper understanding of the Airbnb ecosystem.

**2. Video Game Sales Analysis Using Tableau:**

Step into the realm of video games as I analyze sales data from the gaming industry, all brought to life through Tableau's visualization magic. This project provides a comprehensive view of video game sales trends, exploring factors such as game genre, platform popularity, and regional preferences. By utilizing Tableau's interactive features, I offer a dynamic experience that allows you to dive into the world of gaming sales, from the early days to contemporary trends. Uncover valuable insights about the gaming industry, discover best-selling titles, and explore the impact of various factors on game sales.

Both projects are meticulously documented and transparently presented in this repository. You will find the source code, datasets, Tableau workbooks, and any related resources necessary to understand and reproduce the analysis. Whether you're a data enthusiast, researcher, or simply curious, I invite you to explore these projects, provide feedback, and collaborate with me to gain deeper insights into the worlds of Airbnb and video game sales. Thank you for joining me on this data visualization journey, where we bring data to life through the power of Tableau.

## Data-Professional-Survey-and-Post-Apocalyptic-Supply-Chain-Analysis-with-Power-BI

Welcome to the Data Professional Survey & Post-Apocalyptic Supply Chain Analysis project, where I explore two distinct yet compelling data-driven topics using the power of Microsoft Power BI. In this repository, I invite you to delve into the world of data professionals and navigate the complexities of post-apocalyptic supply chains through the lens of advanced data analytics.

**1. Data Professional Survey Analysis with Power BI:**

In today's data-driven era, understanding the preferences, trends, and demographics of data professionals is more crucial than ever. In my analysis, I focus on a comprehensive survey of data professionals, including data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, and more. Using the capabilities of Power BI, I transform raw survey data into visually captivating representations and interactive reports. Dive into the demographics of the data professional community, explore their career aspirations, gain insights into technology preferences, and discover emerging trends within this dynamic field.

**2. Post-Apocalyptic Supply Chain Analysis with Power BI:**

Imagine a world plunged into chaos, where supply chains are disrupted by unforeseen catastrophes. In this post-apocalyptic scenario, deciphering the intricacies of supply chains becomes a matter of survival. In my analysis, I harness the formidable potential of Power BI to dissect and visualize these disrupted supply chains. Step into this post-apocalyptic world to explore the consequences of disruptions, identify vulnerabilities, craft strategies for resilience, and chart a course toward recoveryâ€”all facilitated by the intuitive analytics capabilities of Power BI.
